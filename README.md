# heat_equation
Python script for solving the transient heat equation in 2D using finite difference method.  
The script uses explicit forward euler time stepping with central differencing for space.  
The results are saved after a desired number of timesteps as .csv files.  
The saved results are used to make an animation of the transient behaviour.
